# clean-browser
### Open your favorite website as a desktop app (windows only)
#### Very useful for working with multiple browser windows and gain visualization space

run:
`python clean-browser.py $url` <br>

or

`python clean-browser.py github twitch` <- name the site. Wish it was more flexible tho <br>

or

`python clean-browser.py github soundcloud.com` <- combine urls with sites<br>
